# Repository for the codes for the Induded Decision Rules project @ Warsaw School of Economics (winter semester 2020/2021). 
In the project using Bundesliga WyScout data 4 different ML models - decision tree, random forest, adaboost and a bagging classifier were used to predict if a goal will be scored given certain parameters of a shot - distance, angle, player's nominal position on the pitch and whether the shot was made with their stronger leg or head.

Project was given 20/20 points.
